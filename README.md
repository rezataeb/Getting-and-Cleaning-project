# Getting-and-Cleaning-project
This is the project for "Getting and Cleaning" course from coursera. 

The source is from : 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The code gets data from above source, merges all the data sets and change the name of columns to the ones which are extracted from the files which include and define measurments. 

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. 

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt .
